jsonquiz
======

Clicking the challenge link, we are brought to a website. I will first run a gobuster
scan using Kali Linux to see if there are any hidden directories we can traverse
into.

Unfortunately, the website seems to have protections against mass web scanning services
by blocking new requests.

Since there's only one page to navigate (to my knowledge), we will go ahead and
take the quiz to see what's going on.

After starting the quiz, I've noticed a few things. The first is that there are
only two tries remaining! The second is that the format seems to be quite similar
to the LinkedIn assessment quizzes.

As expected, no matter what I answer, the quiz will always end in failure. It
won't let me retake the quiz, and so we will have to look at the source code
in order to see if we can bypass this.

Looking at the HTML, we can see that there is a response (and hopefully a flag)
when passing the quiz correctly, so we have to look further into the code to see
what can trigger a pass.

Poking around the cookies and local storage, I found that the website was saving
the quiz attempts client side rather than server side, in the local storage. I
changed this value to a very large number to see if I could take the quiz again.

This allowed me to take the quiz again, but there's no point in taking
the quiz a billion more times if it leads to a fail every time!

After looking at the JavaScript, I've found something that looks promising. It
looks like the devs were implementing a scoring feature but were too lazy to
actually finish it.

The score is set to a static value, and it seems to get updated via a POST request.
The POST request responds with "pass" or "fail" depending on the score, and so
we should try sending a request with a passing score. This can be done with
Burp Suite or with the code written below.

It returned the flag, `corctf{th3_linkedin_JSON_quiz_is_too_h4rd!!!}`!
